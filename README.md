# ðŸŽ² Slow-Burn Roulette

A unique roulette variant built for players who want slower, more suspenseful gameplay.

Instead of instant spin results, numbers are eliminated one-by-one allowing players to watch their odds evolve in real time.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Elimination-style roulette: same odds, better suspense
- Full support for:
  - Color bets (red, black, green)
  - Number bets (0â€“36)
  - Side bets (odd/even, dozens, high/low)
- Real-time odds tracking
- 3 speed settings (slow, medium, fast)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why itâ€™s different

Players donâ€™t just place a bet and win or lose in 1 second. They watch the game unfold, with increasing tension and evolving odds. This adds *emotional investment*, even in small bets.
